## Overview 
As the Chief Data Scientist for the city's school district, this project aims to analyze district-wide standardized test results to provide insights into school performance. By evaluating metrics such as average scores, passing rates, and the impact of school characteristics on student performance, we want to help the school board and mayor make informed decisions regarding future school budgets and priorities.


## Technologies Used
This project leverages several technologies to process and analyze election data efficiently:

- **Python**: The core language used for scripting the analysis, providing robust support for data manipulation and file handling.
- **Pandas**: A powerful library for data manipulation and analysis, used to handle, clean, and analyze the school and student data effectively.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: An interactive computing environment that facilitates data exploration, visualization, and narrative analysis, making it easy to document and present findings.
- **Visual Studio Code**: Chosen as the preferred Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for coding, debugging, and managing the project files.
- **GitHub**: Hosts the repository online, allowing for backup, sharing, and documentation hosting, including this README file.
